FRAUD AND RISK CONTROLS FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

1. Vendor Bank Detail Changes
- Requests to change bank account details are high fraud risk.
- Such changes must always require manual human verification.
- The system must never auto-approve bank detail updates.

2. Duplicate Invoice Risk
- Duplicate invoices often indicate error or fraud.
- Any invoice with the same vendor, invoice number, and amount must be rejected.

3. High Value Payments
- High value invoices above £10,000 require CFO approval.
- Additional checks must be applied for new vendors.

4. Suspicious Patterns
- Urgent payment pressure, unusual accounts, or mismatched supplier emails must be escalated.
